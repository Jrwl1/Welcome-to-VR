# 1) Ignore absolutely everything by default
/*

# 2) Then explicitly keep these at the root
!/.gitignore
!/README.md

# keep Unity’s essential folders
!/Assets/
!/ProjectSettings/
!/Packages/

# 3) Inside Assets, ignore all subfolders…
/Assets/*

# …except Scripts and Scenes (and their .meta files)
!/Assets/Scripts/
!/Assets/Scripts/**/*.cs
!/Assets/Scripts/**/*.meta

!/Assets/Scenes/
!/Assets/Scenes/**/*.unity
!/Assets/Scenes/**/*.meta

# 4) Prevent any other loose files from sneaking back in
# (this is redundant now, but safe)
Library/
Temp/
obj/
Logs/
UserSettings/

# 5) Wipe out any build outputs or IDE files
*.apk
*.exe
*.app
*.sln
*.csproj

# 6) Raw source/art you don’t need in Git
/DesktopBlenderFiles/
/backup mat/
/VRBUILD*    # any folder starting with “VRBUILD”
/Build*/     # Build or Builds folders
